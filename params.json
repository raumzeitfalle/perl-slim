{"name":"Perl-slim","tagline":"Fitnesse Slim protocol implementation for Perl.","body":"### Perl Slim.\r\nThis is an implementation of the Fitnesse Slim protocol (http://www.fitnesse.org/FitNesse.UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.SliM) for Perl.  Combined with fitnesse this allows tests authored on the fitnesse wiki to run through Perl test fixtures against Perl application code.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n* Download and install fitnesse (http://www.fitnesse.org/FitNesseDownload).\r\n* Download perl-slim and unpack/unzip to location you desire.  Since you may install different instances of fitnesse and/or versions of fitnesse over time, you may want to keep perl-slim directory independent of your fitnesse directories.\r\n* Unzip the PerlTutorialsAndExamples.zip file included in perl-slim, and copy the resulting directory to the FitNesseRoot folder of your target fitnesse instance.\r\n* Start fitnesse, and edit the home page of fitnesse to add a link to the PerlTutorialsAndExamples folder, adding this text to page should work to create a link:\r\n\r\n    !3 PerlTutorialAndExamples\r\n\r\n* Navigate into the PerlTutorialAndExamplesPage, and read the SettingUpPerlFitnesse child page for instructions on making the Perl sample fixtures runnable.\r\n\r\n### Help Using Perl Slim.\r\nThe PerlTutorialAndExamplesPage contains a number of runnable examples and snippets of fixture code.  The full fixture code can be found in perl-slim under lib/Slim/SampleFixtures.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWork started originally by @knuthaug in 2009, implementation completed by Jim Weaver in 2015.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact james.weaver@vanderbilt.edu with any questions or issues.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
