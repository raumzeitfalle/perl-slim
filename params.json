Since you may install different instances of fitnesse and/or versions of fitnesse over time, you may want to keep perl-slim directory independent of your fitnesse directories.\r\n* \r\n\r\n### Help Using Perl Slim.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWork started originally by @knuthaug, implementation completed by Jim Weaver.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
